\section{Product Functions}

%\comment{functional Requirements}
In the following, the required functionalities of the product are stated.

\subsection{Features of the App}

The app itself provides functionalities to interact with the sensor (such as to connect and retrieve data), to handle the data (process and store them in a way the web apliccation can acces them) and to invoke the web application.

\subsubsection{General Features}

\begin{description}
  \item[F1.1] The app shall be able to connect to a sensor.
  \item[F1.2] The app shall be able to store information about the location where a set of data is recorded.
  \item[F1.3] The app shall provide a live data view of the sensor feedback in human readable form.
  \item[F1.4] The app shall be able to save the data transferred from a connected sensor.
  \item[F1.5] The app shall be able to invoke the web application inside a browser.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Settings}

\begin{description}
      \item[F2.1] The app shall be able to show information about the sensor (such as settings and state).
      \item[F2.2] The app shall list the connected devices (such as sensor, headset, controller). 
      \item[F2.3] The app shall present an user interface for controlling the connection of the sensor. 
    \end{description}

\subsection{Features of the Web Application}

The web application handles the visualization of the stored data. By using the webVR framework, virtual reality scenes can be created as web sites and therefore be displayed using a browser like Google Chrome.

The web application can be invoked via the app and needs to access the data to generate the virtual reality scene. 

\subsubsection{General Features}
 
  \begin{description}
    \item[F3.1] The web application shall be able to access the stored data.
    \item[F3.2] The web application shall be able to display the stored data at the respective position. 
    
	\item[F3.3] The web application shall allow the user to switch between stereoscopic and normal 3D view.
    
	\item[F3.4] The web application shall allow the user to exit the 3D view and return to the app.
    
	\item[F3.5] The web application shall offer a settings menu where the user can choose which data shall be displayed.    
    
    \item[F3.6] The web application shall contain a visualization of the data which consists of a mesh over all recorded points from the sensor, while the height is the value of the given data.
    
    \item[F3.7] The user shall be able to move the camera around in the virtual reality scene.
