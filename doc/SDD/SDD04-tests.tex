    \textit{Look around:} While in normal 3D mode the tester shall click the screen and drag first up to move the camera up.
    Then move down to move the camera down, then at last left and then right, all the time the camera must follow the movement of the finger.
    After this the tester shall tilt the phone up to move the camera up, then tilt it down, left and right. The camera shall follow the tilt direction of the phone all the time with no delay.

    This test shall be repeated in stereoscopic 3D view. While the clicking and dragging shall not work, the tilting of the phone shall be the only way to pan the camera.

    \textit{Move inside the virtual reality scene:} While in normal 3D mode the tester shall tilt the joystick on the controller forward and the camera shall move forward.
    By tilting the joystick backward the camera shall move back, by tilting left the camera shall move left and by tilting right it shall move right.
    The camera shall always follow the view point, so forward is always in the center of the camera.

    This test shall be again repeated in stereoscopic 3D view and all functions shall work the same.
\end{description}

\begin{description}
	\item[/T0320/]
	\textit{Searching, connecting and disconnecting devices:} The tester shall search a sensor device by pressing the "scan" button in the settings menu. All devices nearby shall be shown in a list with distinguishable entries. By tapping on a list entry a connection to the device shall be established.
	By tapping again on the list entry the connection shall be terminated.
\end{description}

\begin{description}
	\item[/T0330/]
	\textit{Displaying Data:} While in normal 3d mode the tester shall be able to see the data collected from the sensor. The tester shall be able to see
  the date relative to its stored position. \\
  The test shall be again repeated in stereoscopic 3D view and shall work the same.
\end{description}

\begin{description}
	\item[/T0340/]
	\textit{Transferring Bluetooth data:} When the connection to a sensor device is established, the tester shall enter the data view wihin the app and see some representation of the transmitted data which allows him to check the connectivity and functionality to/ of the sensor device.
\end{description}

\begin{description}
  \item[/T0350]
  \textit{Storing Sensor data:} The tester shall be able to connect to a sensor and while connected the data received from the sensor shall be stored together with its current position,
  on the local file system. The tester shall open this file and check if the new data is in it.
\end{description}

\begin{description}
  \item[/T0360]
  \textit{Transferring sensor data to the Web Application:} The tester shall check if the data is transfered to the web application and shall check
  if the data is corresponds to the collected sensor data.
